If the participants have a strong eye dominance or they responded very unreliably, their data are misleading for our purposes. Therefore, we exclude such cases. 

##Eye dominance

We calculate eye dominance by ```rivalry.eye.dominance()``` just after the first session, and if the value is higher than 0.8, we stop the experiments with that subject. 

```{r eyeDominance}
setwd("..")
directory <- paste0(getwd(),"/data") # the folder which contains the data
session   <- 1
data      <- preprocessing_subject(directory,c("Gratings","Images","GratingImage"),"s001",session)
data      <- reorganize_as_table(data)
rivalry.eye_dominance(data)
```
